# Make extensions

Makext is a collection of useful extensions for Makefiles, aimed at
simplifying and enhancing the functionality of Make-based projects. These
extensions provide additional features and convenience functions to
improve the build process, manage dependencies, and streamline common
tasks.

These extensions push the boundaries of GNU Make, which was originally
designed for building software projects rather than serving as a
general-purpose task runner. It's important to keep this in mind while
using them. However, despite this deviation from its intended purpose,
I find myself relying on GNU Make as a task runner in various projects.
